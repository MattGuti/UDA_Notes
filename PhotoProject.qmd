# Introduction

Photography has been around since 1826, when the first ever picture was taken in Germany. This started a hobby/profession that would allow us to document and explore the world around us through the lens of a camera. It allows people to express themselves both artistically and creatively. Getting your photo selected to be in a photo of the year catalog for  huge media outlet is huge accomplishment that many photographers strive to achive. 

I've always been interested in how the image selection process works for top media outlets like CNN, AP, and TIME. Specifically, I wanted to explore what makes an image more likely to be chosen for publication. By analyzing a dataset of images that were selected versus not selected, I aimed to identify key patterns that influence selection and build a model that can predict whether an image will be chosen based on its attributes. This begged the question: Can a model do what a human can do in terms of selecting photos?

# Primary Questions

1. What distinguishes selected images from not_selected images?

2. Can a machine learning model predict whether an image will be selected based on its attributes?


# Data

The dataset consists of about 900 images, split into selected and not_selected categories. The images were preprocessed (resized and normalized) before being used to train a CNN model in Keras and then ultimately loaded into a Strealit web app for ease of use. Below is the code used to scrape for images, resize the images, create a model, train the model, and then create the web app.


## Scraping Selected Images

Here the code is scraping the images from CNN, TIME, and AP for what would go into my "selected" phtoto category.

```{python}
import os
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
from urllib.parse import urljoin
import shutil
import numpy as np

# Saving the Images
IMAGE_DIR = "/Users/mattgutierrez80/Desktop/UDA_Notes/images/selected"
if not os.path.exists(IMAGE_DIR):
    os.makedirs(IMAGE_DIR)

# Target Websites
websites = {
    "cnn": "https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2024/specials/year-in-pictures/",
    "ap": "https://apnews.com/associated-press-100-photos-of-2024-an-epic-catalog-of-humanity",
    "time": "https://time.com/7176286/top-100-photos-2024/"
    }

def download_image(img_url, folder, img_name):
    response = requests.get(img_url, stream=True)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        img_path = os.path.join(folder, img_name)
        with open(img_path, 'wb') as file:
            shutil.copyfileobj(response.raw, file)
        print(f"Downloaded: {img_name}")
    else:
        print(f"Failed to download: {img_url}")

# Function to scrape images from a website
def scrape_images(site_name, url):
    print(f"Scraping images from {site_name}...")
    response = requests.get(url)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')
    
    img_tags = soup.find_all('img')
    img_urls = [urljoin(url, img['src']) for img in img_tags if 'src' in img.attrs]

    for i, img_url in enumerate(img_urls):
        download_image(img_url, IMAGE_DIR, f"{site_name}_{i}.jpg")

# Scraping websites
for site, link in websites.items():
    np.random.uniform(.1, .25, 1)
    scrape_images(site, link)

print("Image scraping completed!")
```



## Scraping not selected images

For my not Selected images I chose to obtain photos from awkward family photos in order to have a set of photos that had not been selected by a commitee. One thing that was different for this scraping was the use of selenium. Awkward family photos usea Java execution so the normal scraping procedure did not work. Also there were many pages of photos to scropp through which selenium does well.

```{python}
import os
import time
import shutil
import requests
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.service import Service
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from webdriver_manager.chrome import ChromeDriverManager

# Saving the images
IMAGE_DIR = "/Users/mattgutierrez80/Desktop/UDA_Notes/images/not_selected"
if not os.path.exists(IMAGE_DIR):
    os.makedirs(IMAGE_DIR)

# Setting up a selenium webdriver
options = webdriver.ChromeOptions()
options.add_argument("--headless")  # Run Chrome in the background
options.add_argument("--disable-gpu")
options.add_argument("--window-size=1920x1080")

driver = webdriver.Chrome(service=Service(ChromeDriverManager().install()), options=options)

# Global counter to track total images downloaded
downloaded_images = 0
MAX_IMAGES = 500

BASE_URL = "https://awkwardfamilyphotos.com/category/photos/random-awkwardness/page/{}/"

def download_image(img_url, folder, img_name):
    """Download an image from a given URL."""
    global downloaded_images
    if downloaded_images >= MAX_IMAGES:
        print("🚀 Reached 500 images! Stopping scraper.")
        return False  

    try:
        response = requests.get(img_url, stream=True, timeout=10)
        if response.status_code == 200:
            img_path = os.path.join(folder, img_name)
            with open(img_path, 'wb') as file:
                shutil.copyfileobj(response.raw, file)
            downloaded_images += 1
            print(f"Downloaded ({downloaded_images}/{MAX_IMAGES}): {img_name}")
            return True
        else:
            print(f"Failed to download: {img_url}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error downloading {img_url}: {e}")
    return False

def scrape_pages():
    """Scrape images from Awkward Family Photos across multiple pages."""
    global downloaded_images
    page_number = 1  

    while downloaded_images < MAX_IMAGES:
        url = BASE_URL.format(page_number)
        print(f"Scraping Page {page_number}: {url}")

        driver.get(url)
        time.sleep(5)  

        img_elements = driver.find_elements(By.TAG_NAME, "img")
        img_urls = []

        for img in img_elements:
            src = img.get_attribute("data-src") or img.get_attribute("src")
            if src and "awkwardfamilyphotos" in src:  
                img_urls.append(src)

        if not img_urls:
            print(f"No more images found on Page {page_number}. Stopping.")
            break  

        print(f" Found {len(img_urls)} images on Page {page_number}.")

        for img_url in img_urls:
            if downloaded_images >= MAX_IMAGES:
                break
            download_image(img_url, IMAGE_DIR, f"awkward_{downloaded_images}.jpg")

        page_number += 1  

# Running the scraper
scrape_pages()

# Closing the browser
driver.quit()

print("Image scraping completed! 500 images saved in:", IMAGE_DIR)


```


## Checking the sizes of the Images

Checking the sizes of the images was crucial in the resizing process to see how many photos needed to be resized.
```{python}
import os
import cv2

DATASET_PATH = "/Users/mattgutierrez80/Desktop/UDA_Notes/images"

def check_image_sizes():
    sizes = {}
    for folder in os.listdir(DATASET_PATH):
        folder_path = os.path.join(DATASET_PATH, folder)
        if not os.path.isdir(folder_path):
            continue

        for img_name in os.listdir(folder_path):
            img_path = os.path.join(folder_path, img_name)
            img = cv2.imread(img_path)

            if img is None:
                print(f"Skipping {img_path}, invalid image")
                continue

            height, width, _ = img.shape
            size_key = f"{width}x{height}"
            sizes[size_key] = sizes.get(size_key, 0) + 1

    print("Image Size Distribution:", sizes)

# Running script
check_image_sizes()

```

## Resizing Images

This is the code I used to resize the images to a uniform size. This makes for better implementation and reading inside my model. The images were saved in a new "resized_images" folder but still under seleted or not selected.
```{python}
import os
import cv2

# Paths
ORIGINAL_PATH = "/Users/mattgutierrez80/Desktop/UDA_Notes/images"
NEW_PATH = "/Users/mattgutierrez80/Desktop/UDA_Notes/resized_images"
IMG_SIZE = (224, 224)  # Standardized image size

# Create a new directory for resized images
if not os.path.exists(NEW_PATH):
    os.makedirs(NEW_PATH)

# Loop through 'selected' and 'not_selected' folders
for category in ["selected", "not_selected"]:
    folder_path = os.path.join(ORIGINAL_PATH, category)
    new_folder_path = os.path.join(NEW_PATH, category)

    if not os.path.isdir(folder_path):
        print(f"⚠️ Skipping {folder_path}, folder not found")
        continue

    # Create the resized folder if it does not exist
    if not os.path.exists(new_folder_path):
        os.makedirs(new_folder_path)

    # Resize each image
    for img_name in os.listdir(folder_path):
        img_path = os.path.join(folder_path, img_name)
        new_img_path = os.path.join(new_folder_path, img_name)

        img = cv2.imread(img_path)
        if img is None:
            print(f"Skipping {img_path}, invalid image")
            continue

        img = cv2.resize(img, IMG_SIZE)
        cv2.imwrite(new_img_path, img)

print("All images resized and saved in:", NEW_PATH)

```

## Creating and training the model

In this code chunk, I created an image selection model using a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) with Keras. I included a pretrained MobileNetV2 base for feature extraction and added custom fully connected layers to adapt the model to my dataset. The MobileNetV2 was necesarry as I did not have a ton of photos so it definitely helped to make the model more accurate.
```{python}
import os
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers, applications
import cv2
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
import hashlib
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator

# Defined dataset path
DATASET_PATH = "/Users/mattgutierrez80/Desktop/UDA_Notes/resized_images"

# Defined constants
IMG_SIZE = (224, 224)
BATCH_SIZE = 32
CATEGORIES = ["not_selected", "selected"]

# Function to load and preprocess images
def load_images():
    data, labels, hashes = [], [], set()
    for category in CATEGORIES:
        class_index = CATEGORIES.index(category)
        category_path = os.path.join(DATASET_PATH, category)

        if not os.path.exists(category_path):
            continue

        for img_name in os.listdir(category_path):
            img_path = os.path.join(category_path, img_name)
            img = cv2.imread(img_path)
            if img is None:
                continue
            img = cv2.resize(img, IMG_SIZE)

            # ✅ Remove duplicates
            img_hash = hashlib.md5(img.tobytes()).hexdigest()
            if img_hash in hashes:
                continue

            hashes.add(img_hash)
            data.append(img)
            labels.append(class_index)

    return np.array(data), np.array(labels)

# Loading dataset and normalize
X, y = load_images()
X = X / 255.0  # Normalize images (0-255 → 0-1)

# Train-Test Split (60% train, 20% validation, 20% test)
X_train, X_temp, y_train, y_temp = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.4, random_state=42)
X_val, X_test, y_val, y_test = train_test_split(X_temp, y_temp, test_size=0.5, random_state=42)

print(f"Training images: {len(X_train)}")
print(f"Validation images: {len(X_val)}")
print(f"Test images: {len(X_test)}")

# Data Augmentation
datagen = ImageDataGenerator(rotation_range=40, width_shift_range=0.2,
                             height_shift_range=0.2, zoom_range=0.2,
                             horizontal_flip=True, fill_mode='nearest')
datagen.fit(X_train)

# Optimized Model with MobileNetV2 (Transfer Learning)
def create_model():
    base_model = applications.MobileNetV2(input_shape=(224, 224, 3), include_top=False, weights="imagenet")
    base_model.trainable = False  # Freeze base layers

    model = keras.Sequential([
        base_model,
        layers.GlobalAveragePooling2D(),
        layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
        layers.BatchNormalization(),
        layers.Dropout(0.5),  # ✅ Reduced dropout
        layers.Dense(len(CATEGORIES), activation='softmax')
    ])

    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
    return model

# Training the model
print("🚀 Training model...")
model = create_model()
history = model.fit(datagen.flow(X_train, y_train, batch_size=32),
                    validation_data=(X_val, y_val),
                    epochs=25)  # ✅ Increased epochs

# Saving the model
model.save("/Users/mattgutierrez80/image_selection_model.keras")
print("✅ Model saved as image_selection_model.keras")

# Plotting the accuracy
plt.plot(history.history['accuracy'], label='Train Accuracy')
plt.plot(history.history['val_accuracy'], label='Validation Accuracy')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

## Checking the prediction level

I used the model and ran predictions on some test photos to check and see if the model was running efficiently. This is where I ran into most of my problems but ultimately tweaked my model enough for it to run efficiently.
```{python}
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
import cv2
import sys

# Loading the trained model
try:
    model = tf.keras.models.load_model("image_selection_model.keras")
    print("Model loaded successfully.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f" Error loading model: {e}")
    sys.exit(1)
model.summary()
# Image size & class labels
IMG_SIZE = (224, 224)
CATEGORIES = ["not_selected", "selected"]

def predict_image(image_path):
    img = cv2.imread(image_path)
    if img is None:
        print(f"Error: Could not read image at {image_path}")
        return

    img = cv2.resize(img, IMG_SIZE)
    img = img / 255.0
    img = np.expand_dims(img, axis=0)

    # Making prediction
    prediction = model.predict(img)
    class_index = np.argmax(prediction)
    confidence = np.max(prediction)

    print(f"🔍 Prediction: {CATEGORIES[class_index]} (Confidence: {confidence:.2f})")

# Test with test image
image_path = "/Users/mattgutierrez80/Desktop/funny4.jpeg"
predict_image(image_path)
```

## Streamlit app generation

I then used Streamlit to create a web app for my model for use of use to drop in pictures without the need for code. I did some neat stuff like adding in a baloon effect when selected and added different sound effects that can be played if the image is selected or not. The sound effect only works if you hit a play button as I could not figure out how to make autoplay work. This was probably the coolest part of my project as I really felt that it had come together into something awesome that I had created.
```{python}
import streamlit as st  
import tensorflow as tf

import cv2

# Getting the absolute path of the current directory
BASE_DIR = os.path.abspath(os.path.dirname(__file__) if "__file__" in locals() else os.getcwd())

# Results

I used 20 images to test my model on and it was able to detect most of them but still stuggled a but when it came to a bad image that was either a meme or just something that was obviously a joke as long as the image was high quality (not blurry or too pixelated) it categorized it as selected. This was still frustrating to me but I got the model to work with most pictures. I would say it categorized about 11 out of 20 photos correctly, which is just over 50%. This is not great but it is a start and I am happy with the results.

I will say that my model was very certain a photo would be selected, as long as the photo was good quality (a well taken photo). That being said, without more photos it was really hard to get the model more accurate than it is now, and that is file. 

# Discussion
 
Looking at the AI’s photo selections compared to what a human would pick, I was surprised by how often they lined up. I expected AI to struggle with the more subtle, artistic choices. While it did in fact stuggle at some points and is still not very accurate, it actually did a solid job.  

I went into this thinking human judgment would be way better, and while it still is, my model definitely held its own. That said, the differences reminded me why humans are still needed. AI can recognize patterns, but it doesn’t have intuition or a creative eye. It can’t fully understand why some images just feel right, which is something that we as humans have mastered.  

Overall, AI can be a helpful tool for narrowing down choices, but it’s not replacing human decision-making anytime soon. For photographers, editors, and content creators, it’s less about letting AI take over and more about using it to save time while keeping control over the final picks. 

This project really did test me and I am really glad to have had the opportunity to create something I find really awesome. The model I created was so much more than I could have ever thought and while it is no where near perfect, I am proud that I made this.
